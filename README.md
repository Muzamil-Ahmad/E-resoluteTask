Nodejs-Login-Module
A simple simple Register and login app written in NodeJS using express framework!

#How it works?

Its a very simple Register and login app using postman. In which the admin role can approve and see the activities of user accounts, where the user has only read permission.

There is a database involved so i have used mysql database to store the data!

#How to use:

Download or clone this repo.
Run npm install
Download eresoluteDb.sql file and import it in mysql.
Run node index.js
Download api collection and use it.

Its just a free time project which i did for learning purpose :)

Thanks and Happy Coding!
