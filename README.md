#How it works?

Its a very simple Register and login app using postman. In which the admin role can approve and see the activities of user accounts, where the user has only read permission.

There is a database involved so i have used mysql database to store the data!

#How to use:

Download or clone this repo.
Run npm install
Run node index.js
open http://localhost:3000
